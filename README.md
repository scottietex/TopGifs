# Project-2 - hosted at https://scottietex.github.io/scottietex.github.io-TopGifs/

Second bootcamp project - TopGifs

TopGifs is a simple website with a search engine that allows users to search for gifs based on the keywords they enter.

Tools used - html, css, Sass, Bootstrap and jQuery

USER STORY 1: As a content creator, I want to find gifs to add humour to my website.

USER STORY 2: As a blogger, I want to find gifs that align with the topics I am blogging about.

Ways to improve: 
Initially wished to create either a recipe website or last.fm API search, however this will perhaps be something to work in for a future project.
